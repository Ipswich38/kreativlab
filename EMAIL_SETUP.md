# Email Blast Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure the Outlook email integration for your CRM email blast functionality.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
- Your Outlook email address that you want to send emails from
- Either your email password or an App Password (recommended for security)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable App Passwords in Outlook (Recommended)

For security, it's recommended to use an App Password instead of your main email password.

1. Go to [Microsoft Account Security](https://account.microsoft.com/security)
2. Sign in with your Outlook account
3. Go to "Security" â†’ "Advanced security options"
4. Under "App passwords", click "Create a new app password"
5. Give it a name like "KreativLab CRM"
6. Copy the generated app password (you'll need this in Step 2)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Update the `.env` file in your project root with your Outlook credentials:

```env
# Email Configuration (Outlook SMTP)
OUTLOOK_EMAIL=your-email@outlook.com
OUTLOOK_PASSWORD=your-app-password-or-regular-password
```

**Replace:**
- `your-email@outlook.com` with your actual Outlook email address
- `your-app-password-or-regular-password` with either:
  - The App Password you generated in Step 1 (recommended)
  - Your regular email password (less secure)

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

After updating the environment variables:

1. **For Vercel deployment:** Add the environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add `OUTLOOK_EMAIL` and `OUTLOOK_PASSWORD`

2. **For other hosting platforms:** Follow their environment variable configuration guide
