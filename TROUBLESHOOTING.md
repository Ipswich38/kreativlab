# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Current Issue: Build Failure

The Vercel deployment is failing because there's a mismatch between the local KreativLab codebase and what's in the GitHub repository. The build is trying to access routes like `/campaigns` and Supabase dependencies that don't exist in our micro-agents platform.

## üîß Solution Options

### Option 1: Force Push Clean Repository (Recommended)

If you have access to force push to the repository:

```bash
# Create a completely new repository
git remote remove origin  # Remove if exists
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kreativlab.git

# Force push our clean codebase
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Option 2: Create New Repository

1. Create a brand new GitHub repository
2. Use a different name (e.g., `kreativlab-platform`)
3. Push our clean codebase to the new repository

```bash
# Remove existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kreativlab-platform.git

# Push to new repository
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Clean the Existing Repository

If the repository has conflicting files, you may need to:

1. Delete all files in the GitHub repository through the web interface
2. Push our clean codebase

## üîç Diagnosing the Issue

The build error shows:
- Dependencies that aren't in our package.json (Supabase, Radix UI components)
- Routes that don't exist in our app (`/campaigns`, `/auth/login`, etc.)
- A different package.json with different project name (`my-v0-project`)

This indicates the GitHub repository contains code from a different project.

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After fixing the repository, verify:

1. **Check Repository Contents**: Ensure only our KreativLab files are present
2. **Verify package.json**: Should show `"name": "kreativsaas"`
3. **Check App Routes**: Should only have `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/layout.tsx`
4. **Dependencies**: Should match our micro-agents platform dependencies

## üöÄ Correct Deployment Process

Once the repository is clean:

### 1. Verify Local Build Works
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard, add:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
# Add database and other env vars as needed
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Variables for KreativLab

For our micro-agents platform, you'll need:

```env
# Required for build
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# Database (when ready to test with real data)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Optional for production start
REDIS_URL=redis://...
```

## üìù Build Requirements

Our KreativLab platform requires:
- Node.js 18+
- No external database for basic build (uses placeholder values)
- No additional build scripts
- Standard Next.js build process

## üîÑ Alternative: Deploy from Local

If repository issues persist, you can deploy directly from local:

```bash
# Deploy directly from local directory
vercel --prod
```

This bypasses the GitHub repository and deploys your local code directly.

## üìû Support

If issues persist:
1. Check the exact error in Vercel build logs
2. Verify repository contents match local codebase
3. Ensure no conflicting files or dependencies
4. Try deploying from a fresh clone of the repository

## üéØ Expected Success

Once resolved, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Clean build with no dependency errors
- ‚úÖ Only KreativLab routes and components
- ‚úÖ Successful deployment to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Working micro-agents platform homepage
